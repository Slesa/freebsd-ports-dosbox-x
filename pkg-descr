DOSBox-X is a cross-platform DOS emulator based on the DOSBox project (www.dosbox.com).

Like DOSBox, it emulates a PC necessary for running many MS-DOS games and applications that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems. However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this. Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows. DOSBox-X additionally features support for DOS/V and NEC PC-98 emulations so that you can play DOS/V and PC-98 games with it.

Our goal is to eventually make DOSBox-X a complete DOS emulation package, both fully-featured and easy to use, while giving users the options to configure the DOS virtual machine. We implement new features with each official release, and also try our best to deliver a consistent cross-platform experience for users instead of focusing on a particular platform. In order to help improve the general DOS emulation and also to help with new DOS developments, it is our desire to maintain and implement accurate emulation, and at the same time we are also making efforts to improve emulation quality, speed, and usability for end users. Furthermore, we hope to improve the out-of-the-box experience for new users who want to run DOS programs or games, while giving them the feeling that they are running native DOS systems.
